      <h2>Experience</h2>
      
      <h3>Writer</h3>
      <h4>Campus Trainer</h4>
      <h5>January 2024- Present</h5>
      <p>
          Write biweekly articles in the Music and Arts section of the
          publication. Every other Monday we have a Zoom meeting to discuss
          pitches from each section editor and the writers. Wednesday we have to
          pick an article by midnight and we have two weeks to complete the
          article.

      <h3>Junior Writer</h3>
      <h4>Music Daily</h4>
      <h5>October 2023- Present</h5>
      <p>
          I write weekly articles for the music section of the online
          publication. Also, I conduct research discovering how to contact
          artists (via their managers, booking agents, etc). Thirdly, I attend
          weekly meetings on Zoom in order to discuss pitches and ensure
          proficiency of articles selected for the publication.

      <h3>Head Counselor</h3>
      <h4>Long Beach Recreation Camp</h4>
      <h5>June 2021- June 2023</h5>
      <p>
          Every Summer from 2021 I would work for the day camp as the head
          counselor. My job was to ensure the safety of children ranging from
          5-8. I would conduct “buddy checks” after every activity to make sure
          we have everyone. When they had an injury or issues, I would bring
          them inside to help them.
